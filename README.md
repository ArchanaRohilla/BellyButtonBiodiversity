# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard
An interactive "Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard" with a panel for demographic information and capability of displaying the bacterial data for each 
volunteer. The volunteers are be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if 
Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza’s volunteers will be able to identify whether
that species is found in quantity in their navel.

## Project Overview
A dashboard has been designed using the data from the samples of some individuals to find the type and 
quantity of the bacterias found in the their belly buttons.

## Software
Plotly, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, D3.json()

## Data source
samples.json

## Summary
- The dashboard shows the demographic information, "Bar" chart, "Bubble" chart, and the "Gauge" which displays 
 the respective informations about an individual as per their "id", which can be selected from the dropdown menu.

- When an individual’s ID is selected, the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) found in his/her belly button is 
 visualized in the bar chart.

- In the Demographics Info panel, all the information of the selected individual’s demographic data is displayed.

- The bubble chart helps to visualize the relative frequency of all the bacterial species found in a volunteer’s navel.

- The gauge chart shows the weekly washing frequency of the individual.

- The dashboard is also published through the Github pages at:
